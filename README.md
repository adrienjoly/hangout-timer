Hangout Timer
=============

A simple stopwatch / hourglass / timer that you can set to 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, or 5 minutes, and that every [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.fr/hangouts/) meeting participant can see.

It was developed to improve productivity during our remote meetings, by granting a 2-minute speaking slot to every team member.
